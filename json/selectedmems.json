I shared the albums I obsessed over during the holiday with someone I started dating when the school term began. I remember once after school we sat in a park atop a big hill and listened to this song on wired headphones we split, nestled under  our jackets we'd prop up over some sticks for shade. ",

In the music video the people made the classic egyptian walk movement. I can remember having a birthday party and this song was played and me, my friends and family did the walk like an egyptian walk. I can still remember it now and it often reminds me of that time when i hear that song now. A great song.",
